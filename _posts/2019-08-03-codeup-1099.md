[Codeup 1099 hardworking ant](https://codeup.kr/problem.php?id=1099)
<br/>
<br/>

-----------------------------------------------------

### Problem description

Gyeonggwok found a research theme, king ant, in the amusement park.

While looking carefully at the king ant, there was an ant that looked especially sincere.

The ant moved the fastest way out of the ant hole to reach its prey.

The ant moved only to the right and then down the road when it encountered an obstacle.

(If there is a path to the right, move it back to the right.)

He was curious about this, put the ant in a maze box and began to look at it.

The ant in the maze box moved only right or down until it found its prey or could no longer move.

The structure of the maze box is given 0 (where it can go), 1 (wall or obstacle).

When the food is given 2 marks, let's anticipate the moving path of the smart ant.

However, it is assumed that it stays there when it arrives at the bottom rightmost point, when it can no longer move, or if it finds food.

The edges of the maze are all made of walls, and the nest of ants must start at (2,2).

<br/>
<br/>

### Input
The structure of the 10 * 10-size maze box and the location of the food are entered.

<br/>
### Output
Print out of the hardworking ant's moving path, marking number 9.

### Source Code
```
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int map[11][11];
    int x, y;
    
    for(y=1; y<=10; y++)
        for(x=1; x<=10; x++)
            scanf("%d", &map[y][x]);
    
    x=y=2;
    
    while(1)
    {
        if(map[y][x]==2) {
            map[y][x]=9;
            break;
        }
        
        map[y][x]=9;
        
        if(map[y][x+1]==0 || map[y][x+1]==2) x++;
        else if(map[y][x+1]==1) {
            if(map[y+1][x]==0 || map[y+1][x]==2) y++;
            else break;
        }
    }
    
    for(y=1; y<=10; y++) {
        for(x=1; x<=10; x++) {
            printf("%d ", map[y][x]);
        }
        puts("");
    }
    
}
```

Although it is one of the most difficult problems in the basic 100 problems, it is not the most difficult one.

The content of the source is 
After receiving input, repeat until you meet the criteria, and then print out the results.

<br/>

It's a two-dimensional array, and you **must not forget that the index in the arrangement starts at zero**.
Declaring a two-dimensional array with [11][11] makes it easier to solve it by substituting coordinates above the actual coordinate plane for the variables x and y.

<br/>

Note that ```puts("");``` means changing the line.  
Other contents seem to have no difficulty to understand.

Please read and understand.
Thanks.
