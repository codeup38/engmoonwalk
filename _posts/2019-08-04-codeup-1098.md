### Problem description
 
Gyeonggwak, who went to the amusement park with his father, saw pulling out sugar snacks (which were shaped like fish by melting sugar).

A few bars of different lengths are placed on the same grid plate as the baduk board.

If he will successes to hide The name of the sugar confection -written horizontally or vertically in succession- on the grid plate (e.g. carp, dragon, etc.)by placing bars on the grid plate, He can get the sugar confection.

It was sort of gambling game that he can take the sugar confection.

Gyeonggwak wants to get the biggest sugar snack.

After looking at every way to put a stick on a gridlock, Gyeonggwak can figure out how to get the biggest sugar confection.

Gyeonggwak wanted to make the basic situation of putting a stick on a grid like putting a baduk egg on a baduk board.

When given the length (h), width (w), number of bars (n), length of each bar (l), direction of placement of bars (d: 0 means horizontal, 1 means Vertical) and the position (x, y) of the most left or topmost of the bar where the bar is placed, let's create a program to print the shape of the bar that fills the grid.
